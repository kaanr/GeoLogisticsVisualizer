### GeoLogisticsVisualizer ðŸ‘‹
An integrated Python toolkit for transforming HTML-based logistics data into actionable geographical insights. This repository contains scripts that parse location data from HTML tables, cleanse and structure it into a pandas DataFrame, and export it to a well-formatted Excel file. It also features advanced geocoding capabilities to convert addresses into GPS coordinates and uses Folium to create interactive maps that visually represent delivery routes and locations. Additionally, the project enhances map interactivity by injecting custom JavaScript for dynamic user interactions. Ideal for logistics analysts, urban planners, and anyone involved in managing and visualizing geographical data for delivery and shipping operations.
